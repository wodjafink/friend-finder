Well, the project may be called friend finder, but really we're trying to find some new Avengers to help battle against Thanos!!

You'll be given the interactive quiz about what kind of Avenger you are most like.  This helps us to match you up with your best Avenger teammates.

Then your profile will be added to the Avengers!

Technical notes:

* Uses Express to provide routes to the various HTML pages and get / post API routes
* Uses Body Parser to send JSON data.  Currently the JSON data is stored in a js file
* Files are neatly organized so that the routes for HTML and API resourcing are separate
* Gave the personality quiz theme a fun twist after watching the new Avengers movie
